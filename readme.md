# Ps4Rpc
Is an Electron App which share your Ps4 status to Discord, very similar to [PlayStationDiscord](https://github.com/Tustin/PlayStationDiscord/) from Tustin, this is in a very early stage, some code could be confusing to you.

thanks to **Imposter** and his good job with a problematic function.

for testing.
``` npm install && npm start ```

after login wait almost 1 min to the cron task get your status, after that restar the app.
